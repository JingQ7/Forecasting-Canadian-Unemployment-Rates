# MATLAB_AnalysisOnCanadianUnemploymentRates

## Data
The adjusted monthly data used in this research is drawn from Statistics Canada for reference years 1976 to 2016.

## Programming Tool and Statistical Techniques
I used MATLAB to clean data and transformed into a stationary time series,  build time-series regression model and predict unemployment rates.

## Models and Forecasting
This paper estimated the performance of AMRA model, checked the volatility and build the conditional heteroscedastic model
– GARCH model. Finally using ARMA (1,1)—ARCH (1,1) models to forecast unemployment rates for the following 10 years.
