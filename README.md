# MATLAB_AnalysisOnCanadianUnemploymentRates

The adjusted monthly data used in this research is drawn from Statistics Canada for reference years 1976 to 2016.

I used MATLAB to clean data,  build time-series regression model and predict unemployment rates for the following 10 years.

This paper estimated the performance of AMRA model, checked the volatility and build the conditional heteroscedastic model
– GARCH model. Finally using ARMA (1,1)—ARCH (1,1) models to forecast unemployment rates.
